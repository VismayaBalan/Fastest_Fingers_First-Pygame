# Fastest Fingers First
"Fastest Fingers First" is a simple typing game where the player controls a space shuttle at the bottom of the screen and letters fall from the top of the screen. The player must type the letter on their keyboard that matches the falling letter before it reaches the bottom of the screen. Each correct letter increases the player's score and the speed of the falling letters increases as the player's score gets higher. The game ends if a falling letter collides with the player's space shuttle or if the player closes the game window.

## How it Works ?
The project is a game called "Fastest Fingers First". The objective of the game is to type the letter displayed on the screen as fast as possible. The game is played on a 2D game window using the Pygame library.

The game starts with a space shuttle at the bottom of the screen and a randomly chosen letter falling from the top of the screen. The player must type the letter before it reaches the shuttle. If the player types the correct letter, they earn a point, and a new letter falls from the top of the screen. If the player types the wrong letter or the letter reaches the shuttle, the game is over. The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the screen.

The game difficulty increases as the player earns more points. The falling letters move faster, and the player has less time to type them correctly.

Once the game is over, the player's final score is displayed on the screen, and the game waits for a few seconds before quitting.
## Libraries used
Pygame
## How to configure
To configure the game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Pygame can be installed using pip.
## How to Run
you can run the game by opening a command prompt or terminal, navigating to the directory where the code is saved, and running the following command:
 python fastest_fingers_first.py
This will start the game and you can play it by typing the letters shown on the screen before they reach the bottom of the screen. The objective is to score as many points as possible before colliding with a letter or allowing it to reach the bottom of the screen.
